  "Aether is a map of quiet escapes. These are places to pause, reflect, and let your mind wander. Some are peaceful corners in a busy city, others are hidden green spaces, calming views, or simple spots that help you breathe a little easier. You can explore locations others have shared or add your own.",
  "To suggest a place, right-click anywhere on the map and click Suggest. A small window will open where you can describe the spot and submit it. Your suggestions help others discover calm, inspiration, and small moments of stillness in the world around them.",
